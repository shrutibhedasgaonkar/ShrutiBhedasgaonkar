## Hi, I'm Shruti 👋

Business Analyst and QA Lead with 11+ years of experience delivering high-quality software and business change across healthcare, retail, and enterprise environments. I combine strong quality assurance expertise with hands-on business analysis to support complex system and data migrations and digital transformation initiatives.

As a Tester / QA Lead, I have end-to-end ownership of testing for complex programmes, including test strategy, planning, functional, regression, integration, and UAT execution, defect management, and stakeholder reporting. I am proficient with Selenium, Python, SQL, Jira, Confluence, and Azure DevOps, with a strong track record of accelerating regression cycles and reducing defect leakage through structured test frameworks and automation.

As a Business Analyst, I am experienced in requirements elicitation, business process analysis, and end-to-end validation for system and data migrations, including legacy platform replacements. I translate business needs into clear, testable requirements, define acceptance criteria, and support User Acceptance Testing and benefits realisation by working closely with stakeholders and cross-functional Agile teams.
